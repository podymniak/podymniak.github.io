        <h2>Salutations, Strugglers!</h2>
        <p>
            Exhausted by the sluggish website loading? The relentless scrutiny of each click? The agonizing quest for the right task in the endless sea of spaces, projects, folders and lists and the maddening game of hide-and-seek with the report button in the ever-changing layout? Are you frustrated with investing more time into reporting a task than actually working on it?
        </p>
        <br><h3>The drama ends here!</h3>
        <p>
            Behold the savior - ClickPup - your one and only salvation! With this revolutionary tool, you can report your time directly from the Google calendar.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An hour-long meeting? Just select the task from the user-friendly dropdown menu, and voilÃ  - you just reported an hour!</li>
            <li>The meeting repeats weekly? Already taken care of! Your previous selections are saved, so no need to hunt down the same task twice.</li>
            <li>Don't have meetings? Transform your calendar into a retroactive timesheet!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So what's the holdup? There are zero reasons not to embrace the awesomeness of ClickPup.
