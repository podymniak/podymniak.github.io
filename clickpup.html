        <h1><br><b>1. What's this all about? üìÖ</b></h1>
        <p>
            <b>‚úß Behold ‚úß</b> our amazing Google Calendar addon, enabling time reporting to ClickUp Tasks directly from your calendar! With no official name, this addon ensures easy, quick and headache-free reporting, updating, and deleting of time entries. Use it independently (reporting all entries from your calendar) or alongside ClickUp platform!
        </p>

        <h1><br><b>2. How do I use it?</b></h1>
        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Install addon from the Google Workspace and agree to the necessary access. Once installed, you will find the addon on the sidebar of your Google Calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
                When opening the addon for the first time, you will be prompted to provide an access token. This is a one-time setup process. The access token allows the addon to establish a connection with your ClickUp account.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After providing the access token and pressing enter, your tasks will be loaded and saved to your user properties (accessible only to you). With that, you can begin reporting your time entries üöÄ
        </p>
        <p><i>
            NOTE: ClickUp Tasks are not loaded directly from the ClickUp platform on every click. You need to use the 'Update tasks list' button after assigning yourself to a new task. Only non-closed tasks that are assigned to you will be visible in the task selection section.
        </i></p>

        <h3><br>üìù Reporting</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create a new event / click on an existing event in your Google Calendar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find and click on your task in the task selection section.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="centered">
            <b>‚ú® Your time is now reported! ‚ú®</b>
        </p>
        <p>Reported properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start time - start time of the calendar event,</li>
            <li>Duration - duration of the event,</li>
            <li>Task - as selected from the addon dropdown,</li>
            <li>Billable - based on your selection, OFF by defaul,</li>
            <li>Entry description - calendar event title.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Events on which the addon is used will change colors. Event Status Colors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reported event - displayed in sage color.</li>
            <li>Assigned event - displayed in lavender color.</li>
            <li>Deleted entry - displayed in tomato color.</li>
        </ul>


        <h1><br><b>3. Additional features ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</b></h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the meeting owner assigned it to a task, other participants will have that task visible as well, so no need for them to search for it*. You can also report time to a different task than the meeting‚Äôs owner without changing it for others.
            </li>
            <li>
                For recurring meetings, the assigned task will be remembered after the first report. Assigned tasks can be reported by clicking the REPORT button.
            </li>
            <li>
                The addon allows entry update for duration, description, billability, date, and task, as well as deletion of entries.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can report your out-of-office events - addon will report 8h/day excluding weekends.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>
            *Please note that your tasks or entries within the addon are not visible to other users. The only exception is when you, as the meeting organizer, report an event to a task that is not available to other meeting participants. In this case, they will be able to see the task's name but will not be able to report time there or open the task to see details.
        </i></p>
